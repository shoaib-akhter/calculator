# calculator

## Description

This project is a **simple calculator application** developed as part of the Odin Project's Foundations course. The primary goal of this project is to create a functional and visually appealing calculator that performs basic mathematical operations.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Exponentiation**: A dedicated `xⁿ` button for calculating powers.
- **Responsive Design**: The calculator layout adjusts for various screen sizes using Flexbox.
- **Interactive UI**: Buttons include hover and active effects for a better user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the calculator.
- **CSS**: Styles the calculator with a clean and modern design.
- **JavaScript** (to be implemented): Handles all the calculator's functionality.

## Project Structure

### Files

- `index.html`: Contains the structure of the calculator, including rows and buttons.
- `style.css`: Defines the styling for the calculator layout, buttons, and interactivity.
- `script.js` (future implementation): Will handle the logic for mathematical operations.

### Layout Details

- **Display Section**: Positioned at the top for showing inputs and results.
- **Top Row**: Includes `CLEAR`, `BACK`, and `xⁿ` buttons for specialized functions.
- **Number Buttons**: Arranged in a grid for easy access.
- **Operator Buttons**: Styled distinctly and aligned to the right.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd calculator
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the calculator.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement JavaScript for full functionality.
- Add support for keyboard input.
- Enhance responsiveness for smaller screens.
- Include advanced features like parentheses and memory functions.
